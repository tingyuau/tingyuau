## 👋 Hi, I’m Joy!

### 🚀 Systems Engineer | MDO & MBSE Innovator | Founder of OptimiSE

I’m a Systems Engineer by trade and an innovator at heart. My passion lies in tackling the challenges of developing complex multidisciplinary systems—from aerospace to emerging technologies.

Through Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO) and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), I help organisations streamline their design processes, reduce inefficiencies, and unlock better engineering decisions. This passion led me to found OptimiSE and OptimiSE Academy, where I provide consulting services and online courses to empower engineers with cutting-edge methodologies.

#### 🔍 What I Do:
✅ MDO & MBSE Integration – Bridging disciplines for optimised system design.
✅ Consulting & Training – Helping engineers and organisations improve digital engineering workflows.
✅ Content Creation – Sharing insights and strategies for mastering MDO and MBSE.
